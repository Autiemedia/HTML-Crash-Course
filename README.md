# HTML-Crash-Course
An example website I built to learn about specific tags in HTML and gain an understanding of how things are built and work.
I'm following along with Front End Simplified. I'm a fast learner who has experience with HTML 5 from the past, so I'm hoping to break through it quickly.
This website is not meant to have a good order or a good look, but it does show off certain features and has notes to clear up other things.
I'm sure somebody with average sense could learn a thing or two just by looking at the HTML pages.
